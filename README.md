# Transfer_Learning_Based_Automobile_Image_Classification

## Introduction
This project focuses on addressing an image classification problem specific to automobile images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures based on transfer learning. The methodology encompasses two key approaches: the feature extraction method and the deeper layer fine-tune method. By combining these approaches, the project aims to efficiently and effectively classify automobile images, demonstrating the potential of transfer learning in image classification tasks.
